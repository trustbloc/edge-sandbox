Feature:
  Scenario: setup fabric
    Given DCAS collection config "dcas-mychannel" is defined for collection "dcas" as policy="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')", requiredPeerCount=1, maxPeerCount=2, and timeToLive=60m
    Given DCAS collection config "docs-mychannel" is defined for collection "docs" as policy="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')", requiredPeerCount=1, maxPeerCount=2, and timeToLive=60m
    Given off-ledger collection config "meta_data_coll" is defined for collection "meta_data" as policy="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')", requiredPeerCount=0, maxPeerCount=0, and timeToLive=60m

    Given the channel "mychannel" is created and all peers have joined

    And "system" chaincode "configscc" is instantiated from path "in-process" on the "mychannel" channel with args "" with endorsement policy "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" with collection policy ""
    And "system" chaincode "sidetreetxn_cc" is instantiated from path "in-process" on the "mychannel" channel with args "" with endorsement policy "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" with collection policy "dcas-mychannel"
    And "system" chaincode "document_cc" is instantiated from path "in-process" on the "mychannel" channel with args "" with endorsement policy "OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" with collection policy "docs-mychannel,meta_data_coll"

    And fabric-cli network is initialized
    And fabric-cli plugin "../../.build/ledgerconfig" is installed
    And fabric-cli context "mychannel" is defined on channel "mychannel" with org "peerorg1", peers "peer0.org1.example.com,peer1.org1.example.com" and user "User1"

    And we wait 10 seconds

    # Configure the following Sidetree namespaces on channel 'mychannel'
    # - did:bloc:sidetree       - Path: /document
    Then fabric-cli context "mychannel" is used
    And fabric-cli is executed with args "ledgerconfig update --configfile ./fixtures/fabric/config/ledger/mychannel-consortium-config.json --noprompt"
    And fabric-cli is executed with args "ledgerconfig update --configfile ./fixtures/fabric/config/ledger/mychannel-org1-config.json --noprompt"
    And fabric-cli is executed with args "ledgerconfig update --configfile ./fixtures/fabric/config/ledger/mychannel-org2-config.json --noprompt"

    # Wait for the Sidetree services to start up on mychannel
    And we wait 10 seconds
